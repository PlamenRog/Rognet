# Rogne
Rogne is meant to be a complete replacement for proprietary VPN services, and is meant to be used for easily hosting LAN services.
It uses its own custom VPN protocol(or at least it should by the end of the initial development stage).

The project started when I realized hamachi isn't FOSS, and is generally intended to be a replacement.
